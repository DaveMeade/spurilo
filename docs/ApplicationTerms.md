# Application Terms & Domain Vocabulary

## Core Concepts

### Compliance Framework
A structured set of guidelines, standards, and best practices for ensuring organizational security and regulatory compliance.

**Examples:**
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Risk-based approach to cybersecurity
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management systems
- **SOC 2** - Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- **PCI-DSS** - Payment card industry data security standard

### Audit
A systematic examination of an organization's security controls, processes, and systems to verify compliance with established frameworks.

**Types:**
- **Internal Audit** - Conducted by organization's own staff
- **External Audit** - Performed by independent third-party auditors
- **Compliance Audit** - Focused on regulatory requirements
- **Security Audit** - Comprehensive security posture assessment

### Risk Assessment
The process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating security risks to determine their potential impact and likelihood.

**Components:**
- **Risk Identification** - Discovering potential security threats
- **Risk Analysis** - Evaluating likelihood and impact
- **Risk Evaluation** - Determining risk acceptability
- **Risk Treatment** - Implementing mitigation strategies

## Audit Management Terms

### Audit Cycle
The complete process from audit planning through reporting and follow-up.

**Phases:**
1. **Planning** - Scope definition and resource allocation
2. **Fieldwork** - Data collection and control testing
3. **Reporting** - Documentation of findings and recommendations
4. **Follow-up** - Verification of remediation efforts

### Audit Finding
A deficiency or weakness identified during the audit process.

**Classifications:**
- **Critical** - Immediate attention required, high risk
- **High** - Significant impact, prompt remediation needed
- **Medium** - Moderate impact, should be addressed
- **Low** - Minor issue, may be addressed as resources permit

### Remediation
The process of addressing and correcting identified audit findings or security deficiencies.

**Stages:**
- **Acceptance** - Acknowledgment of finding validity
- **Planning** - Development of corrective action plan
- **Implementation** - Execution of remediation activities
- **Verification** - Confirmation of effective remediation

## Risk Assessment Terms

### Risk Score
A quantitative or qualitative measure representing the level of risk associated with a particular threat or vulnerability.

**Calculation Methods:**
- **Quantitative** - Numerical values based on probability and impact
- **Qualitative** - Descriptive categories (Low, Medium, High)
- **Hybrid** - Combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches

### Control
A safeguard or countermeasure implemented to reduce security risks.

**Categories:**
- **Preventive** - Controls that prevent incidents from occurring
- **Detective** - Controls that identify incidents when they occur
- **Corrective** - Controls that respond to and recover from incidents
- **Compensating** - Alternative controls when primary controls aren't feasible

### Vulnerability
A weakness in a system, process, or control that could be exploited by a threat.

**Types:**
- **Technical** - Software bugs, misconfigurations, weak encryption
- **Physical** - Inadequate facility security, unsecured equipment
- **Administrative** - Poor policies, insufficient training, weak processes
- **Human** - Social engineering susceptibility, insider threats

## Compliance Terms

### Control Objective
A statement describing the desired outcome or purpose of a security control.

### Evidence
Documentation or proof that demonstrates the effective implementation and operation of controls.

**Types:**
- **Design Evidence** - Documentation of control design and implementation
- **Operating Evidence** - Records showing control operation over time
- **Inquiry Evidence** - Information obtained through interviews
- **Observation Evidence** - Direct observation of control operation

### Gap Analysis
The process of identifying differences between current security posture and desired compliance state.

### Remediation Plan
A structured approach to addressing identified gaps and deficiencies.

**Components:**
- **Action Items** - Specific tasks to be completed
- **Responsible Parties** - Individuals accountable for completion
- **Target Dates** - Planned completion timelines
- **Success Criteria** - Measures to verify completion

## Reporting Terms

### Dashboard
A visual interface displaying key metrics and status information about compliance and security posture.

### Compliance Report
A formal document summarizing the organization's compliance status, audit results, and remediation progress.

**Standard Sections:**
- **Executive Summary** - High-level overview for leadership
- **Methodology** - Approach and standards used
- **Findings** - Detailed audit results
- **Recommendations** - Suggested improvements
- **Action Plan** - Remediation roadmap

### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
A measurable value that demonstrates the effectiveness of security and compliance programs.

**Examples:**
- **Audit Finding Resolution Rate** - Percentage of findings remediated within target timeframe
- **Risk Score Trend** - Changes in overall risk posture over time
- **Compliance Score** - Percentage of controls effectively implemented
- **Mean Time to Remediation** - Average time to address findings

## System-Specific Terms

### Framework Mapping
The process of aligning organizational controls with specific compliance framework requirements.

### Control Assessment
The evaluation of control design and operating effectiveness.

**Assessment Types:**
- **Design Assessment** - Evaluation of control design adequacy
- **Operating Assessment** - Testing of control operation over time
- **Walkthrough** - Step-by-step review of control process
- **Inspection** - Review of relevant documentation

### Audit Universe
The complete set of auditable areas within an organization's scope.

### Risk Register
A document that records identified risks, their assessments, and treatment plans.

**Standard Fields:**
- **Risk ID** - Unique identifier
- **Risk Description** - Detailed explanation of the risk
- **Risk Owner** - Person responsible for managing the risk
- **Risk Score** - Current risk assessment
- **Treatment Status** - Current state of risk mitigation

## Configuration Terms

### System Configuration
JSON-based settings that control system behavior without code changes.

### Configuration Validation
The process of ensuring configuration values are valid and within acceptable ranges.

### Feature Flag
A configuration-controlled mechanism to enable or disable specific functionality.

### Helper Interface
A well-defined set of functions that allow systems to communicate without direct dependencies.
